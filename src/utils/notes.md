# Missing (out of the planned features for ver 0.1):
   - all of the codegen for the language.
   - string literals
   - printf() (to show string literals in the output, needs linking with libc)
   - codegen for structs
   - codegen for postfix operators on structs
   - semantic analysis and codegen for pointers
   - if, else, for, while statements (basic control flow)
   - match construct
   - enums (done as sum types)
   - pointers
