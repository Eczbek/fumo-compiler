# Missing (out of the planned features for ver 0.1):
   - all of the codegen for the language.
   - string literals
   - printf() (to show string literals in the output, needs linking with libc)
   - codegen for structs
   - codegen for postfix operators on structs
   - semantic analysis and codegen for pointers
   - if, else, for, while statements (basic control flow)
   - match construct
   - enums (done as sum types)
   - pointers
   - remove const keyword and add mut keyword, make const the default

ðŸ“Œ Summary Roadmap
   - Finish LLVM codegen for variables, arithmetic, and functions.

   - Add pointers (load/store, address-of).

   - Make function calls work.

   - Add struct layout + member access.

   - Add string literals.

   - Add if/else, while.

   - Polish docs + example programs.
